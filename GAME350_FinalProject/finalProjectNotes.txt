questions to ask

1) why do i need a rigidbody on one of two objects for OnTriggerEnter() to work?
2) Portal script only works if I set the ai GameObject to the clone.
3) if the ai is teleported to the other portal, how do i "reset" its waypoint index to the correct one?


1) Elevator pitch of game idea
- It is a tower defense game with a secondary mechanic inspired by the game "Portal". As one of the "towers", 
the player can place portals on the map that can teleport the enemies from point A to B. 
 
2) Be able describe your core and secondary mechanics
Core - 		Spawning of enemies, eliminating enemies with attacks from "towers"
Secondary - 	Portals that can teleport enemies from point A to B, 
		upgradable attack range of towers with coins, 
		different types of towers (attacking type, coin-farming type, trap type)

3) Describe your progress
- I can spawn enemies
- I have portals that teleport the enemies from point A to B.

4) Describe your next steps
- implement coin feature
- implement life feature
- implement tower attacks


1) grab the two nearest waypoints from the enemy
2) choose the waypoint that has the higher index



PROGRESS
1) Portal
	- Problems
		- if i place the PortalOut in between index 5 and 6, 
		the enemy will move towards 5th waypoint rather than 6th waypoint 
		because it is technically closer.
